This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl: accessing an array element beyond its defined bounds. The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` offers a corrected version.  The error arises from attempting to access an index that does not exist within the array, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or program crashes.
